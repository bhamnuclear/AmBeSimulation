# This example is for AmBe source simulation

## Dependencies
- Geant4
- ROOT
- OpenMPI or other MPI interface 

MPI can be disabled in CMake and main. In any case, it can be chosen at runtime whether to run with or without MPI via the `AMBE_MPI` environment flag: set this either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

## MPI USAGE
Use with [https://github.com/bhamnuclear/Geant4-MPI/](https://github.com/bhamnuclear/Geant4-MPI/), here available in the `Geant4-MPI` folder.

compile Geant4 MPI first using `Compile.sh` or othewrwise, then compile this simulation:
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DG4mpi_DIR=$PWD/../Geant4-MPI/install/lib/G4mpi-11.3.1 ..
$ make
```
Please replace 11.3.1 with your Geant4 version.


Run with
```$ AMBE_MPI=true mpirun --mca accelerator rocm -n 2 ambe -t 8 macros/shortlong.mac```
or 
```$ AMBE_MPI=true mpirun -n 2 ambe -t 8 macros/shortlong.mac```


## Current Status
1. Scoring has been implemented correctly
2. Full Multithreading and MPI support
3. AmBe and 239PuBe sources. Other sources have only been partially implemented
6. World material is `G4_AIR`


## Usage
Various options have been implemented using cli. It is also possible to use macros, but there is no full support for these and they have not been fully tested. Some macro commands can replace cli commands, but some of the macro commands cannot replace cli commands.

Note that cli commands are more stable and do not cause crashing when run once the simulation is initialised.

### Cli commands
Options list (as listed in main.cc)
- `-i` `--interactive` -> enable GUI. Default OFF is options specified.
- `-t` `--threads` -> Specify number of threads to use. If using MPI, this is the number of threads allocated to each node. DEFAULT 1.
- `-ffs` `--fissionFragmentsScore` -> Enable scoring of fission fragments (neutrons and Ions). DEFAULT OFF.
- `-r` `--isotope` -> Specify Neutron Source to use. 0 is AmBe, 1 is 239PuBe. DEFAULT AmBe.
- `-in` `--initialNeutrons` -> Score initial neutrons from the Priamry Generator. DEFAULT OFF.
